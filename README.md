# TestAssignment
2d Project with Drag&amp;Drop
Unity Version - 2022.3.62f3 LTS

The project implements a Drag&amp;Drop mechanic for building a tower of cubes with animations, height limitation, and state persistence.
Placement logic and save system responsibilities are clearly separated and easily extendable through interfaces.
DOTween is used for animations, UniRx for game event handling, and Zenject for dependency injection.
The tower state is saved and restored between sessions.
